# Python_Extract-Outlook-Mails

This is my short python code in order to extract the received mails from my work shared email.<br>

Because we have created a lot of subfolders for proper archiving it was not easy to extract them properly via outlook. <br>
This script will help you:<br>

✔️ Extract your mails from all the subfolders <br>
✔️ Filter a date range <br>
✔️ Exclude mail adressed from your query <br>
✔️ Extract in excel file including date/subfolder name/ subject/ first characters of the email body<br><br>

Would love to here your feedback or questions
