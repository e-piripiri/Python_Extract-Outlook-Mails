# Python_Extract-Outlook-Mails

This is my short python code in order to extract the received mails from my work shared email.

Because we have created a lot of subfolders for proper archiving it was not easy to extract them properly via outlook. 
This script will help you:
✔️ Extract your mails from all the subfolders
✔️ Filter a date range
✔️ Exclude mail adressed from your query
✔️ Extract in excel file including date/subfolder name/ subject/ first characters of the email body

Would love to here your feedback or questions
